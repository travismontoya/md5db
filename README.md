md5db
======

Creates a database of md5 hashes from a word list. My purpose behind creating this was
I needed a list of md5 hashes from a word file. 

### Word lists
Put each word on its own line.

### MD5 DB
This will later be moved over to sqlite, but for now the file is saved in the format
of "string:md5" with a new line seperating each one.
