md5db
======

Creates a database of md5 hashes from a word list. Allows you to find the strings
based off a hash as well.

### Word lists
Put each word on its own line.

### MD5 DB
This will later be moved over to sqlite, but for now the file is saved in the format
of "<string>:<md5>" with a new line seperating each one.
